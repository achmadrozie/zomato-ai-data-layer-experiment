{% docs mart_order_item_city_currency_day_source %}
One row per source order date, order city, and parent-order currency. All order statuses are included. The many-to-one join to fact_order supplies currency without adding order-level measures. The left join retains an unmatched item as a null-currency bucket, which fails the currency not-null check rather than silently dropping it. Source and calculated amounts remain separate; monetary totals require a currency-specific scope.
